# Workout-Tracker
Workout Tracker utilizing MongoDB

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

This application allows users to track their workouts for a given day by adding the exercises completed and details on those exercises. statistics on the users workouts can also be displayed and all the saved data can be viewed as well.

Routes:
/stats - provides stats and graphs based on your most recent workouts
/index - displays info on your most recent workout
